# Coding-Otakus
Our project is about Hostel Management Web application using Python tools(Python IDE:Spyder,Qt Designer) and database(PhpMyAdmin).

  ## Hostel Management Concept:
  An hostel management application makes use of Object Oriented Analysis and Design.Minimal Code is written in the GUI and the entities are   decoupled as well. The interface is created using Qt Designer.This project was created during Mumbai Hacakathon 2019.
  #
  The Class Diagram explains the Database Schema used during project creation.

# Actors:-
  The actors include the following:
  #
    1.  Warden(Main Administrator)
    2.  Security Guard
    3.  Receptionist
  ## User Cases:-
  After determining the actors, the second step in use case analysis is to determine the tasks that each actor will need to do with the       system. Each task is called a use case because it represents one particular way the system will be used.
  #
  #### In other words, only those use cases are listed that actors will need to do when they are using the system to solve the customer’s         problem.
  #
  ### 1. Warden:
  	❏ Add/Remove a new student to the hostel.
        Allocate/Deallocate rooms to students.
        Check how many rooms are completely/partially occupied for allocation.
    ❏ Update student's information whenever applicable.
    ❏ All of the Security Guard's and Receptionist's information .
    ❏ Adding/Removing Security Guard/Receptionist.
  
   #
  ### 2. Security Guard:
    ❏ Add/Delete Visitor's information in the database.
    ❏ Restrict access for visitors if they've crossed the limit of 1 visit/week.
    ❏ View the student's name,id and room number.
    
 #
  ### 3. Receptionist:
    ❏ Only access the rooms of a given student.
    ❏ View the student's name and room number.
